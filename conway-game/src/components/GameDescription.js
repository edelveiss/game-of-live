        The Game of Life is a type of cellular automaton, created by British
        mathematician John Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning
        that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no
        further input.
      </p>
      <p>
        Common pattern types include: still lifes, which do not change from one
        generation to the next; oscillators, which return to their initial state
        after a finite number of generations; and spaceships, which translate
        themselves across the grid.
